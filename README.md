# PshatGPT

**Live: [pshatgpt.com](https://pshatgpt.com/)**

AI-assisted tzuras hadaf. Click any line of Gemara, Rashi/Rashbam, or Tosafot — get a contextual explanation streamed to you.

Pshat (פשט) = the plain-meaning reading. This tool gives you that first layer, fast, with the commentary structure intact.
### Please note that this is still under development and will be updated often... feel free to help out!
## Quick start

1. Open [pshatgpt.com](https://pshatgpt.com/)
2. Pick a tractate + daf → click anything Hebrew → watch Claude explain it

**No setup needed** — you get 10 free explanations/day through a shared proxy.
For unlimited, click ⚙ Settings and paste your own Anthropic API key
([get one](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)). Your key stays in
your browser's localStorage and is sent directly to Anthropic.

## How the free tier works

A tiny Cloudflare Worker (in [`worker/`](./worker)) proxies requests to
Anthropic using the owner's API key, with per-IP rate limits (10/day). When
you add your own key in Settings, the browser calls Anthropic directly and
the proxy is bypassed — so the free tier budget is preserved for people who
don't have keys.

## What it does

- Loads any daf of Talmud Bavli from Sefaria (all 37 tractates indexed)
- Displays the gemara with Rashi/Rashbam + Tosafot attached, in a tzuras-hadaf-style layout
- Every Hebrew segment and every dibur hamatchil is clickable
- On click: opens a modal and streams a contextual explanation from Claude (Anthropic API)
- Explanations locate the text in its sugya, unpack the reasoning, and name the chiddush

## Architecture

PshatGPT runs in **two modes**:

### Static mode (deployed on Hostinger)

```
Browser (on pshatgpt.com)
   │
   ├──▶ Sefaria REST    (text + commentaries, CORS-enabled)
   └──▶ Anthropic API   (streaming, key from localStorage)
```

Pure static site. Zero backend. Deploys from `/docs` on master.

### Local dev mode (FastAPI)

```
Browser  ↔  FastAPI (gemara/web.py)  ↔  Sefaria / Anthropic
```

Same UI, but the Python backend proxies API calls — useful for iterating on
the agents, caching, and logging.

- **Sefaria** supplies all Hebrew/Aramaic text and commentaries via its public REST API (no auth).
- **Anthropic Claude** (claude-sonnet-4-5) generates the explanations. You bring your own API key.
- **No server-side storage** of keys or user data. Your key lives in your browser.

## Local setup

Requires Python 3.11+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ys770/PshatGPT.git
cd PshatGPT
pip install fastapi uvicorn httpx pydantic anthropic pymupdf
python -m gemara.web
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000 and enter your Anthropic API key in Settings (⚙).

Get an Anthropic API key at https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys.

## Usage

1. Pick a tractate from the dropdown (grouped by seder)
2. Enter a daf number + select amud a/b → click **Load**
3. The daf renders with Rashi/Rashbam in the left margin, Tosafot in the right
4. Click any Hebrew text — gemara line, Rashi comment, or Tosafot piece — to get an explanation
5. **Double-click** a gemara segment to toggle its English translation

## Per-tractate commentary mapping

Most of Shas uses Rashi + Tosafot. Exceptions:

- **Bava Batra** (29a onward): Rashbam takes over from Rashi
- **Nedarim**: Ran is the primary commentary
- ...and a few others handled in `gemara/shas.py`

## Status

**This is a preview.** It works end-to-end for clicking gemara/Rashi/Tosafot and getting a Claude-streamed explanation, but there's meaningful work still ahead.

Some planned features may eventually move behind a paid tier.

## Roadmap

**Core quality:**
- [ ] **Deeper pshat-style reasoning** — explanations tuned to read the text the way a rebbi would: context-aware, sugya-aware, faithful to the classical meforshim
- [ ] **Authentic tzuras hadaf** — true Vilna-style page layout with the gemara wrapping around Rashi and Tosafot (not the current 3-column approximation)

**Features:**
- [ ] PDF-scan view toggle (calibrate tzuras hadaf images from the Shas Nehardea set)
- [ ] Cross-reference navigation — click into an explanation's citations
- [ ] Save / pin explanations for review
- [ ] Difficulty heatmap (meforshim density per segment)
- [ ] More commentaries beyond Rashi+Tosafot (Ramban, Ritva, Rosh...)
